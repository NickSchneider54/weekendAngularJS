# Final Project

This project started off as a side project to learn the Angular framework, but ended 
up morphing into my final project. I learned a lot this semester, but my time in WebDev II
can be split into two distinct, at least to me, parts: before Hack4Good and after Hack4Good.
I learned so much from the experience, but the most important thing I took away from it was
the distance between where I was and where I need/want to be. This understanding was a major
driving force for this assignment, that and the enjoyment I got from working on it.
